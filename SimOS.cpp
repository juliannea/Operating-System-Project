  Creates a new process with the specified priority in the simulated system. The new process takes place in the ready-queue or immediately starts using the CPU.
  Every process in the simulated system has a PID. Your simulation assigns PIDs to new processes starting from 2 (1 is reserved for the OS) and increments it by one for each new process. Do not reuse PIDs of the terminated processes.
  For example, the command NewProcess(1000, 5) means that a new process with priority level 5 should be created and it requires 1000 bytes of memory.
  NewProcess returns true if a new process was successfully created and false if otherwise. One of the reasons a process wasnâ€™t created is insufficient free memory in the system.
